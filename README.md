# CS230-Operating-Platforms

•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room has a successful Android game, Draw It or Lose It, and they are interested in moving the game to be operational on multiple platforms. This game consists of multiple players on multiple teams and comes with an image library to be utilized as clues each round. Each team and player must have a unique name within the game and only one instance of the game can be played at a time.

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

One of the elements of this project that I feel that I did well in were the naming conventions we integrated and being able to reference the players, teams, and games and ensure there are no duplications.

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Being able to utilize a design document helps break down the overwhelming task of the applications layout to a manageable level and helps compartmentalize and easily identify the information within the program.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think that the one part of this document that I would like to revise would be the architecture referencing and the differences between ARM and X86. I don’t feel as though I went in depth enough and really provided clarity on how these factors operate and affect the application.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

With this project, the user already had a successful application that they were looking to expand upon. Maintaining the identity of the application while making changes to adapt to new platforms was one of the most important aspects to the client. Being able to take the information that the client is requesting, and prioritizing and converting it to an actionable process from a programmer’s stand point is the only way that we can make sure that we successfully provide the client with their request.

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The first approach that I took once we received the client’s request is to create a pseudocode and a diagram to understand processes and flows necessary to deliver. I feel as these have been the most helpful for me as it clarifies order and needs within this (or any) application.
